-- COALESCE
/* 1. Our favourite manager wants a detailed long list of products, but is afraid of tables! 
We tell them, no problem! We can produce a list with all of the appropriate details. 

Using the following syntax you create our super cool and not at all needy manager a list:

SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || product_size|| ' (' || product_qty_type || ')'
FROM product

But wait! The product table has some bad data (a few NULL values). 
Find the NULLs and then using COALESCE, replace the NULL with a 
blank for the first problem, and 'unit' for the second problem. 

HINT: keep the syntax the same, but edited the correct components with the string. 
The `||` values concatenate the columns into strings. 
Edit the appropriate columns -- you're making two edits -- and the NULL rows will be fixed. 
All the other rows will remain the same.) */

SELECT 
product_name || ', ' || ifnull(product_size, '')|| ' (' || coalesce(product_qty_type, 'unit') || ')'
FROM product

You can either display all rows in the customer_purchases table, with the counter changing on
each new market date for each customer, or select only the unique market dates per customer 
(without purchase details) and number those visits.

/* 2. Reverse the numbering of the query from a part so each customer’s most recent visit is labeled 1, 
then write another query that uses this one as a subquery (or temp table) and filters the results to 
only the customer’s most recent visit. */

customer_purchases table that indicates how many different times that customer has purchased that product_id. */
